## Downloading old documents
You can see all the previous permit applications from Scott's
manual spreadsheet parsings here,
except for a couple that went missing.

If you want to integrate them with your csv file,
switch everything in the respective urls before the
final (sixth) slash for
"`https://raw.github.com/tlevine/mvn-www2-backup/master/documents`"

For example,
[`http://www2.mvn.usace.army.mil/ops/regulatory/pdf/document2011-09-09-103911.pdf`](http://www2.mvn.usace.army.mil/ops/regulatory/pdf/document2011-09-09-103911.pdf)
becomes
[`https://raw.github.com/tlevine/mvn-www2-backup/master/documents/document2011-09-09-103911.pdf`](https://raw.github.com/tlevine/mvn-www2-backup/master/documents/document2011-09-09-103911.pdf)

You can also download them all at once
[here](https://github.com/tlevine/mvn-www2-backup/archive/master.zip)
